**Ethereum Contract Delegate Call Demo**

**This repo demonstrates a delegate call between two contracts:**

- Calling Contract: Calls the "Called Contract".
- Called Contract: Has an orderStatus variable.

**Result:**
- orderStatus remains unchanged in "Called Contract".
- It updates in "Calling Contract".
